# MuZero-Style Models and Monte Carlo Tree Search

Coursework portfolio notebook for Behrad Mazaheri.

## Contents

- `notebook.ipynb`: supplied implementation with historical outputs, review banner and privacy cleanup.
- `REVIEW.md`: interpretation limits and implementation concerns.
- `DATA_REQUIREMENTS.md`: runtime inputs and missing files.
- `requirements.txt`: dependency inventory, not a tested lockfile.
- `evidence/`: source hash, execution inventory and saved text outputs.

## Use

Read the review and input requirements first. Create a separate environment for this folder, install dependencies, launch Jupyter, and open the notebook. Run from this folder unless source paths specify otherwise. Historical outputs may depend on old APIs, seeds, hardware or files absent here. No training or Run-All was performed during packaging.

## Result interpretation

Educational MuZero-style implementation rather than a full paper reproduction. The fallback changes the episode horizon. Search includes root noise; distinguish exploratory training returns from a fixed evaluation policy. The custom frame stack uses an internal API, not a complete standard Gymnasium wrapper contract.

## Attribution

Original course, template and reference credits remain in the notebook. Completed assignment templates do not establish sole authorship. Confirm personal contributions before using the CV wording. No new license is assigned to course material or third-party assets. Student number and transient metadata were removed.
